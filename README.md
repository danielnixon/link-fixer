# Link Fixer

The default behaviour of ctrl+click, shift+click and cmd+click when clicking on links is to open the link in a new tab or new window. This behaviour is sometimes [broken by careless developers](https://superuser.com/questions/854797/why-does-ctrl-click-not-open-some-links-in-a-new-tab/). This add-on restores the default behaviour, ensuring the modifer keys are always respected.
